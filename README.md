## Description
Managing the component tree in React involves organizing components hierarchically to maintain a clear structure and ensure efficient rendering. Parent components pass data to child components through props, allowing for a unidirectional data flow, which simplifies state management and debugging. Additionally, leveraging state management libraries, like Redux or Context API, can help in managing shared state across deeply nested components, enhancing the overall performance and scalability of the application.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
2. Start the frontend application locally
```bash
npm start
